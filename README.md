monitormanager
==============

A Google Chrome extension and Python Tornado application for managing Chrome tabs on monitors.

Run the server and install the extension in Chrome on each monitor you wish to manage. Use the extension to set the host and port of the server, and open tabs and assign them names. Then navigate to the server in your browser to configure names. From there, you can change URLs on monitors and propagage them instantly, as well as reload (or force-reload) them by name.
